What has keys but can't open locks?|A piano|
What can travel around the world while staying in a corner?|A stamp|
What has hands but cannot clap?|A clock|
What has to be broken before you can use it?|An egg|
I’m tall when I’m young, and I’m short when I’m old. What am I?|A candle|
What gets wetter as it dries?|A towel|
What has a head and a tail but no body?|A coin|
